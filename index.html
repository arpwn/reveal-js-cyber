					<h3>What is Cybersecurity</h3>
					<p>
						Is the way we use techniques to protect individuals and organizations, also to be prepared for inbound attacks.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why we should care?</h3>
					<p>
						We should care about our data and online presence, nowadays we are more vulnerable online than in real life,
						because of the information we share daily online, also the forms we submit can be stolen by hackers. 
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Hackers purposes</h3>
					<p>
						If we think of how our data will be used once obtained by other, we might tink just for selling, but another actions
						such as using personal information for identity fraud or botnet network can cause more harm using your data.

						<h3>The Cube</h3>
						<p>
							The McCumber Cube is a model framework created by John McCumber in 1991 to help organizations establish and evaluate
							information security initiatives by considering all of the related factors that impact them. This security model has 
							three dimensions:
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Dimensions</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>The foundational principles for protecting information systems.</li>
							<li>The protection of information in each of its possible states.</li>
							<li>The security measures used to protect data.</li>
						</ol>

						<h3>Protecting information</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Is a set of rules that prevents sensitive information from being disclosed to 
							unauthorized people, resources and processes. Methods to ensure confidentiality include:
							<strong>Data encryption, identity proofing and two factor authentication</strong>  
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							<strong>Integrity: </strong> Ensures that system information or processes are protected from intentional or accidental modification. 
							One way to ensure integrity is to use a hash function or checksum.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							<strong>Availability: </strong> Means that authorized users are able to access systems and data when and where needed and 
							those that do not meet established conditions, are not. This can be achieved by maintaining equipment, performing hardware repairs, 
							keeping operating systems and software up to date, and creating backups.
						</p>

						</div>
						<h3>Protection of information in each state</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>Processing: </strong> Refers to data that is being used to perform an operation such as updating a database 
							record (data in process).
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							<strong>Storage: </strong> refers to data stored in memory or on a permanent storage device such as a hard drive, 
							solid-state drive or USB drive (data at rest).
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							<strong>Transmission: </strong> refers to data traveling between information systems (data in transit).
						</p>
					</section>

						<div class="r-stack">
							<img index="0" src="./assets/three.png" width="450" height="300">
						</div>
						<h3>Security measures to protect data</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>Awareness, training and education: </strong> Are the measures put in place by an organization to ensure 
							that users are knowledgeable about potential security threats and the actions they can take to protect information systems.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							<strong>Technology: </strong> Refers to the software- and hardware-based solutions designed to protect information systems 
							such as firewalls, which continuously monitor your network in search of possible malicious incidents.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							<strong>Policy and procedure: </strong> Refers to the administrative controls that provide a foundation for how an organization 
							implements information assurance, such as incident response plans and best practice guidelines.
						</p>

						<h3>Key motivations of cyber-attacks</h3>
						<p>Political, challenge, sabotage, competitiveness, financial and social</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p><strong>Political</strong></p>
						<p>
							It is common in electoral campaigns electoral parties try to sabotage their opponent leaking data and stealing sensitive 
							data that compromise elections.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
						<p>
							Some hackers feel motivated to bypass protections of systems only to prove the system is vulnerable and take credit for that forums of
							the dark web.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p><strong>Sabotage</strong></p>
						<p>
							Meanwhile other just want to cause harm to distributed systems and organizations, or even personal purposes using advanced techniques
							to remain on the systems and cause long-term issues.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p><strong>Competitiveness</strong></p>
						<p>It is well know attacks against large companies is performed to get data and know the next steps of the competitor to gain advantage in the market 
							through espionage.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p><strong>Financial</strong></p>
						<p>Nowadays financial instituions are targeted by daily sophisticated cyber attacks such as APT attacks to steal huge amounts of money and credit cards
							to finance ilegal activities.
